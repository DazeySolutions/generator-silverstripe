> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is this generator

It scaffolds out a bare-bones [SilverStripe](http://www.silverstripe.org/) site for local development, including a basic [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) workflow for your theme.

### Are there any requirements?

You'll need [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) if you haven't already got it.

Then you need to make sure you have Apache, MySQL and PHP running, an empty database ready, and the local domain name of your site added to your `/etc/hosts` file, eg. `127.0.0.1 my-project.dev`.

You could use something like [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/) to manage all the above, or do it yourself - [here's a helpful guide](http://akrabat.com/php/setting-up-php-mysql-on-os-x-yosemite/) (if you're on OS X Yosemite).

### How do I use it

Once you've done all the above simply run the following command in an empty directory and answer the questions:

```bash
yo silverstripe
```

### Help
